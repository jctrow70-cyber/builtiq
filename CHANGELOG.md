## BIQ-0002 - Strength/Team RLS Security Hardening

Date: 2026-07-07  
Branch: develop  
Status: Completed

### Summary

Tightened Supabase row-level security for the strength/team MVP so users can only access teams and programs they belong to, while owners/editors retain template edit access and members can log only their own set data.

### Purpose

Phase 2 security work. The previous policies allowed any authenticated user to modify workout templates if they knew record IDs. Team membership and invite join were not enforced at the database level.

### Changes

- Added RLS helper functions for program read/edit and team membership checks
- Replaced permissive `st_workouts`, `st_exercises`, and `st_planned_sets` policies with program-scoped access
- Restricted `st_teams` and `st_team_members` reads to owners and active members
- Added `st_join_team_by_invite` RPC with transaction-local approval for secure invite joins
- Updated app join flow to use RPC instead of direct team lookup + insert
- Fixed stale team/invite state when switching accounts (derive active team from current user's team list)

### Files Changed

- `app/page.tsx`
- `supabase/migrations/20250707_001_tighten_strength_team_rls.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20250707_002_fix_team_join_rls.sql`

### Database Changes

Run in Supabase SQL Editor (in order):

1. `supabase/migrations/20250707_001_tighten_strength_team_rls.sql`
2. `supabase/migrations/20250707_002_fix_team_join_rls.sql`

Adds helper functions, replaces `st_*` policies, and adds `st_join_team_by_invite`. No tables dropped. No data deleted.

### Testing Steps

- Personal user: create program, log sets, refresh — data persists
- Team owner: create team, generate program, edit exercises
- Team editor: edit shared program templates
- Team member: view program, log sets, cannot edit templates (UI and direct API)
- User A cannot read User B's personal program or list all teams
- Join team with valid invite code succeeds
- Join without valid invite code fails
- Sign out and sign in as different user — invite code matches only that user's teams
- Mobile layout still usable on Training and Teams screens

### Known Issues

- Existing programs are unaffected; RLS applies immediately after migration
- `st_join_team_by_invite` must exist before deploying app code that calls it

### Recommended Commit Message

```text
BIQ-0002 Harden strength/team RLS and secure team join flow
```

## BIQ-0003 - Workout History Stability

Date: 2026-07-07  
Branch: develop  
Status: Completed

### Summary

Completed workout logs now store snapshot metadata at save time and survive template edits or exercise removal. Progress tab shows saved lift history from snapshots.

### Purpose

Workout history must be reliable. A completed workout should represent exactly what the user did at that time, even when program templates change later.

### Changes

- Added snapshot columns to `st_set_logs` (exercise name, muscle, section, set info, targets, workout day/type)
- Backfill snapshots for existing logs where template data still exists
- Changed `planned_set_id` foreign key to `ON DELETE SET NULL` so logs are not deleted when templates change
- Updated set log RLS to allow reading snapshot-only rows after template removal
- `saveLog()` writes snapshot fields on every upsert
- Lift history (`Last time`, placeholders) prefers snapshot fields with legacy join fallback
- Progress tab lists completed sets grouped by date and exercise using snapshots

### Files Changed

- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/globals.css`
- `supabase/migrations/20250707_004_set_log_snapshots.sql`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`

### Database Changes

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

- `supabase/migrations/20250707_004_set_log_snapshots.sql`

Adds snapshot columns, backfills existing logs, changes FK to `SET NULL`, updates set log RLS policies.

### Testing Steps

- Run migration `20250707_004_set_log_snapshots.sql`
- Log sets for an exercise in Training
- Open Progress — confirm date, exercise, and logged weight/reps appear
- As owner/editor, rename or remove that exercise from the template
- Refresh Progress — logged history still shows original exercise name and numbers
- Training placeholders (`last 185`, etc.) still work for remaining template exercises
- Sign out/in — history persists for the same user only

### Known Issues

- Logs saved before migration rely on backfill; orphaned logs without snapshots may not appear in history
- Editing a log after its planned set was removed is not supported (read-only orphaned rows)
- PR charts and trends still planned for a later phase

### Recommended Commit Message

```text
BIQ-0003 Stabilize workout history with set log snapshots
```

## BIQ-0004 - Workout Plan Sections and Exercise Organization

Date: 2026-07-07  
Branch: develop  
Status: Completed

### Summary

Improved program generation and workout editing with distinct **Warm Up / Prep** and **Strength** sections, inline exercise management, and separate planned-target vs log inputs for sets.

### Purpose

Phase 3 workout MVP work. Generated plans previously mixed warmup sets into every lift and used browser prompts for editing. Workouts needed clearer structure aligned with BuiltIQ training module design.

### Changes

- Added `section` column to `st_exercises` (`warmup`, `strength`)
- Updated program templates to generate warmup exercises and strength exercises separately
- Removed auto-generated per-lift warmup sets from strength exercises in new programs
- Grouped Training UI by section with counts and section-scoped reorder
- Replaced `prompt()` exercise editing with inline add/edit controls
- Added editable planned targets (weight, reps, RPE) separate from log inputs for owners/editors
- Improved `+ Set` to append the next working set with sensible defaults

### Files Changed

- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/globals.css`
- `supabase/migrations/20250707_003_exercise_sections.sql`

### Database Changes

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

- `supabase/migrations/20250707_003_exercise_sections.sql`

Adds `st_exercises.section` (default `strength`) and index on `(workout_id, section, sort_order)`. Existing exercises default to `strength`.

### Testing Steps

- Run migration `20250707_003_exercise_sections.sql`
- Generate a **new** program — confirm Warm Up / Prep and Strength sections appear
- Add exercise to each section via inline form
- Reorder exercises within a section — order does not cross sections
- Edit planned targets and log actuals — both persist after refresh
- Existing pre-migration programs show exercises under Strength (expected)
- Mobile layout: section headers, add row, and set grid remain usable

### Known Issues

- Programs created before this change do not automatically get warmup section exercises
- Plyometrics / Power section not added yet (future change)

### Recommended Commit Message

```text
BIQ-0004 Add workout sections and improve exercise/set organization
```
